Bambu hotend is widely embraced by 3D printing enthusiasts due to its lightweight and high efficiency. Currently, numerous hobbyists online have made enhancements to Bambu hotend to adapt it to various printer models. The Sherpa Mini is a lightweight extruder that utilizes the BMG gear kit, which has undergone topological optimization while ensuring structural integrity. This project has improved the mounting structure to enable compatibility between Bambu hotend and the Sherpa Mini extruder. The project has already been 3D printed and validated, and if any issues arise, please feel free to raise them as an issue.
